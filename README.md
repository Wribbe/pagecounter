Pagecounter
===========

Given the amount of pages needed to read and an exam date, calculate
how much you have to read in a given period of time to be in phase.

Setup:
------

The simples way to get thing running with pytest seems to be to install the
script.
To do this run the following (preferably in an virtualenv):

  `pip install -e .`

inside the project root-folder.
After this is done, the tests can be run with the command:

  `py.test`
